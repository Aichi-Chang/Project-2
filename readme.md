### üö© Project-2 - A + L (Pair project) ###
The second project of the software engineering immersive course at GA London is a small Hackathon(Reacathon). The assignment was to build a React app that uses an external API, the project will be completed in a team of two within 48 hours.

A + L is the initial of the team members for this project. It also stands for art and life. This is a platform where users can search for all kinds of exhibitions or lifestyle event info. They will be able to check the event location or get redirected to the actual event page from the map. The external API used for this project is from [The LIST](https://api.list.co.uk/).

### :rocket: Get Started ###

* Clone or download the repo
* `npm init`
* `npm run serve` to start


### üìù Brief ###

* **Consume a public API** ‚Äì this could be anything but it must make sense for your project.
* **Have several components** - At least one classical and one functional.
* **Include wireframes** - that you designed before building the app.
* **The app should include a router** - with several "pages".
* **Have a visually impressive design**
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public.

### üïπ Technologies used ###

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (ES6)
* React
* Mapbox
* Webpack
* Bulma
* Babel
* Insomnia

Challenges:
This is an instant duo group project after just learning React for a week. The challenge is to apply React straight away on this project, as there are a few new concepts than JavaScrip, like components, state and props‚Ä¶ The second challenge is working in a team with another developer(we were teamed up randomly by the teaching group) The communication definitely plays an important part in the work.

Wins:
Found a great external API for the project
Applied React MapBox into the APP
Understand a high-level of React
Got more used to JavaScript and CSS
Great teamwork
