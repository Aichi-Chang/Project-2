Challenges:
This is an instant duo group project after just learning React for a week. The challenge is to apply React straight away on this project, as there are a few new concepts than JavaScrip, like components, state and propsâ€¦ The second challenge is working in a team with another developer(we were teamed up randomly by the teaching group) The communication definitely plays an important part in the work.

Wins:
Found a great external API for the project
Applied React MapBox into the APP
Understand a high-level of React
Got more used to JavaScript and CSS
Great teamwork
