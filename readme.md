### ðŸš© Project-2 - A + L (Duo) ###
The second project of the software engineering immersive course at GA London is a small Hackathon(Reacathon). The assignment was to build a React app that uses an open-source API, the project will be completed in a team of two within 48 hours.

Visit the site here - [A + L](https://aichi-chang.github.io/Project-2/), or you can also find the GitHub repo - [GitHub](https://github.com/Aichi-Chang/Project-2)

Challenges:
This is an instant duo group project after just learning React for a week. The challenge is to apply React straight away on this project, as there are a few new concepts than JavaScrip, like components, state and propsâ€¦ The second challenge is working in a team with another developer(we were teamed up randomly by the teaching group) The communication definitely plays an important part in the work.

Wins:
Found a great external API for the project
Applied React MapBox into the APP
Understand a high-level of React
Got more used to JavaScript and CSS
Great teamwork
